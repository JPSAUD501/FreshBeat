# Fresh project

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting Started" guide here: https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

### Environment

AI-powered features now run exclusively through OpenRouter. Make sure to set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (and keep `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` configured for image generation) so the bot can route requests through https://openrouter.ai:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: API key generated on OpenRouter.
