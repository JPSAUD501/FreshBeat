First, carefully read the following song lyrics and image description provided by the user.

Before creating your explanations, analyze the lyrics and consider how the image might represent the song's themes.

Lyric and Image Analysis:
1. Identify the main themes and emotions in the song lyrics.
2. Quote key lyrics that represent these main themes.
3. Note any significant metaphors or symbolism used in the lyrics.
4. List potential interpretations of the image.
5. Connect image elements to lyrical themes.
6. Consider how the image might represent or enhance these themes and emotions.
7. Think about the overall message or story the song is trying to convey.
8. Reflect on how you can make the summarized explanation intriguing enough to encourage reading the complete explanation.

Complete Explanation:
- Interpret the main themes and messages of the song.
- Explain any metaphors or symbolism used in the lyrics.
- Ensure that your explanation makes sense in the context of how the image represents the song, without explicitly describing the image or its relationship to the lyrics.
- Aim for 150-200 words.

Summarized Explanation:
- Capture the essence of the song in 2-3 sentences.

- Aim for 30-50 words.

Emoji Representation:

  "lyric_and_image_analysis": "[Your thorough analysis here]",
  "complete_explanation": "[Your complete explanation here]",
  "summarized_explanation": "[Your summarized explanation here]",
  "emoji_representation": "[List of emojis here]"
}

Remember:
- Focus on explaining the song lyrics, not the image.
- Don't explicitly explain the relationship between the image and the lyrics.
- Ensure both explanations are coherent with how the image represents the song.
